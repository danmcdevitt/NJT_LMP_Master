**Current LMP Site Setup:** Next.js 16.0.3 app with React 19, currently deployed on Vercel with GitHub integration. Static site with client-side rendering, images stored locally in `/public/images/` folder (112+ images, no optimization). No backend API - uses environment variables for configuration. Build process: standard Next.js build, deployed automatically via Vercel on git push. Planning migration to Google Cloud Platform to match Partners In Travel architecture pattern.
